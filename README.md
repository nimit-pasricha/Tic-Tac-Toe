# Tic-Tac-Toe

Simple Tic-Tac-Toe (X and O) game made using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

Made for practicing factory functions, organizing javascript code by returning objects from functions, using Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE), and generally trying to have as little global code as possible.
